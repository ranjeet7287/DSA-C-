1.Palce yourself at start point.
2.Explore all the path possible from the starting point.
3.Insert your element at only correct possible postion and once inserted.
  Move onto smaller problem
4.Once you reach base case , print your solution
5.Once you explore all the path from one point , Backtrack to your previous point.
