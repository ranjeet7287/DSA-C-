This Approch for the fibbonacci Number without using Dynamic Programing we are using 
Recursion here/
if n=6
                         6
                  /           \ 
                  5             4  
               /    \          /    \
              4      3        2      1
            /  \    /  \    /  \   /   \
           3   2   2   1
           .
           .
           .
           .
           till 1 or 0 so as you see we are doing same work repedatily so through dyanamic
           Programing we can reduce part of doing same work again again.
Step 1 -> To Determine the repitation.
Step 2 -> Who many call are thier or Who many unique answer are thier which are required
          to saved.
Step 3 -> We will make an array of size n+1.
Step 4 -> Check answer is already exists or not. 
              --> YES -> Pick answer and return.
              --> NO  -> Calculate -> Save -> return
