/*
Which of the following data type stores longest decimal number ?
long
float
double
short


Solution Description
Out of all given options, only float and double can hold decimal numbers. 
Size of the float is 4 bytes and double is 8 bytes (in most of the compilers, 
as the size of data types is compiler specific). 
So double can store bigger decimal numbers.
