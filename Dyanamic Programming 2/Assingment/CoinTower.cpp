Whis and Beerus are playing a new game today. They form a tower of N coins and make a move in alternate turns. Beerus plays first. In one step, the player can remove either 1, X, or Y coins from the tower. The person to make the last move wins the game. Can you find out who wins the game?
 Input format :
The first and the only line of input contains three integer values separated by a single space. They denote the value of N, X and Y, respectively.
Output format :
Prints the name of the winner, either 'Whis' or 'Beerus' (Without the quotes).
Constraints :
1 <= N <= 10 ^ 6
2 <= X <= Y<= 50

Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
4 2 3
Sample Output 1 :
Whis
Sample Input 2 :
10 2 4
Sample Output 2 :
Beerus
