// QUSE 1
// Circular doubly LL
// Send Feedback
// Given an unsorted circular doubly linked list, suppose you have reference (or pointer) to its head node only, which of the following operation can be implemented in O(1) time?
// i) Insertion at the front of the linked list
// ii) Insertion at the end of the linked list
// iii) Deletion of the last node of the linked list
// iv) Deletion of the front node of the linked list

// Ans -> 1 2 3 4 


// QUES 2
// Traversal in LL
// In doubly linked lists, traversal can be done in ?
// Ans 2 -> Both Direction -- > Reverse and Forward
